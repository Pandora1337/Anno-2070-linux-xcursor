# Anno-2070-linux-xcursor
An XCursor theme from Anno 2070 made for Linux. Because I like that game.
Used [this](http://www.rw-designer.com/cursor-set/anno-2070) as the basis, then added new variants using [RW Cursor Editor](http://www.rw-designer.com/cursor-maker).

# Installation
### Manually
1. Move the `Anno-2070` folder into `/usr/share/icons`:
```
sudo mv Anno-2070 /usr/share/icons/
```
3. run 
```
sudo update-icon-caches /usr/share/icons/Anno-2070
```
3. Then chose the theme using your distros theme selector.
For example, in Linux Mint find "Themes" app and toggle `Advanced settings...`. Mouse Pointer is the option you are looking for

### Using Script
